SproutGuides
============

Documentation for the SproutCore framework. For more information on SproutCore,
see the [homepage](http://www.sproutcore.com) or the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore).


## Getting Started

To generate the files, you'll first need to have
[Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) installed. Once you have Bundler, you can

    git clone git://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides.git
    cd sproutguides
    bundle install --binstubs

Once you've completed these steps, whenever you need to generate the
documentation, you run

    ./bin/guides generate

and this will output the results to the output/ folder. If you have any
questions, the team can be reached at [@sproutcore](http://twitter.com/#!/sproutcore) or [#sproutcore](irc://irc.freenode.net/sproutcore)
