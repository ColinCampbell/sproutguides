h3. What to Contribute?

* We need authors, editors, proofreaders, and translators. Adding a single paragraph of quality content to a guide is a good way to get started.
* The easiest way to start is by improving an existing guide:
** Improve the structure to make it more coherent.
** Add missing information.
** Correct any factual errors.
** Fix typos or improve style.
** Bring it up to date with the latest release of SproutCore.
* We're also open to suggestions for entire new guides:
** Contact the documentation team to get your idea approved. See the Contact section below.

h3. How is the process?

* TBD
